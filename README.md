# Bombus Distribution Analysis

This repository contains the materials and analysis for the project **"Analyzing and Predicting Bombus Latreilleâ€™s Distribution Across North America Using Hierarchical Bayesian Models"**.

## Project Description
This project aims to analyze the distribution of **Bombus Latreille (bumblebees)** in North America, using **Hierarchical Bayesian Models** to understand 
the relationship between environmental factors (e.g., temperature and floral resources like Monarda L.) and species presence. 
The findings contribute to the field of species distribution modeling and provide actionable guidance for biodiversity conservation.
